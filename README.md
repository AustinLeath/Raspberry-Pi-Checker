# Raspberry-Pi-Checker
This repository is meant to be used by people who need to make sure that all of their Raspberry Pi's are online

In my personal setup for work we have a bunch of Raspberry Pi's that we use for digital signs that are located all around our building. It was impossible to tell if there was a Pi that was offline so I designed this in order to help us monitor them better.
